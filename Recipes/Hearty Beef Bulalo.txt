Ingredients :
8 cups water
1/2 kg beef shank, cut to serving pieces
1/2 cup onion, chopped
2 pcs Knorr Beef Cubes
1 pc sweet/japenese corn, cut into 3
2 -3 pcs saba, sliced diagonally into 2
1 cup baguio beans, cut into 1-inch pieces
1 pc Pak-Choi/Pechay Baguio, sliced
To taste black pepper


Cook :
1. Begin by getting a large pot and fill it with water. Let the water boil together with the beef shanks and onions. Let it simmer for 1.5 hours or until beef is tender. Remember to remove the scum from the surface of the water every now and then, to ensure your soup will be nice and clear.

2. Now drop in the Knorr Beef Cubes, corn and sliced saba.

3. Mix in Baguio beans and pechay and just simmer for a minute.

4. Give this soup a nice seasoning of pepper and that's our dish! Just like mom, a big serving of Bulalo is enough to fill your day with good thoughts and warm hugs.
